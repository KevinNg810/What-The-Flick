# What-The-Flick
## What is this?

This is an ETL project that extracts and parses data from the top 250 movie lists of all times from www.imdb.com and www.flickchart.com. The program then cleanses and saves the dataframes as CSV files. It then uses the merge function to combine the two dataframes to create an overall top 100 movie list. It then loads it to a database to perform queries and other functions.
